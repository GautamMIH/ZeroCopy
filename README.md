# ZeroCopy
ZeroCopy is a lightweight, low-latency screen capture and streaming system that functions like a software capture card over Ethernet. It uses GPU-native capture, hardware video encoding, and unicast UDP transport to stream displays between computers with minimal CPU overhead and zero manual network configuration.

Designed to behave like a device rather than an application, ZeroCopy prioritizes zero-copy data paths, auto-discovery, and LAN-safe networking to deliver near-hardware capture performance without dedicated capture hardware.
